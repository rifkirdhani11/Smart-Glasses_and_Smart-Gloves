# Smart-Glasses_and_Smart-Gloves

Tulibot's smart gloves and smart glasses is attented to people with hearing impairment, to make it easier for them to communicate with other speakers. 
Smart Glove was attached by the flex sensor and IMO MPU6050 for sensing fingers and hand movement. The microcontroller is used in the research was Arduino Nano to read flex sensors and MPU6050 sensors. While the smart Glasses are the wearable computing device used as an extension for deaf, which can be attached to the spectacles or sunglasses of the wearer, and can be paired with Tulibot Android Application, via Bluetooth. This extension, contains an Arduino Nano-controller having ATmega328p microprocessor, which is programmed to connect with smart phone.
Application of Tulibot's smart gloves and smart glasses is attented to people with hearing impairment, to make it easier for them to communicate with other speakers. Hopefully in the future, the application of Tulibot can be expand to something more, that can bring more advantages for the user of this device. Accuracy of this device is approximately at 80% for Smart Glove and 90% for Smart Glasses, based on the test done by the team.
